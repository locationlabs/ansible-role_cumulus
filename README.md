## Port Policies

It may be desirable to set a default switch-wide port configuration, such as MTU. This is simply yaml to json.

Example:

```yaml
config:
  port_policy:
    address:
      defaults:
        mtu: 9216
```

For more information, see [Setting a Policy for Global System MTU](https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/display/DOCS/Layer+1+and+Switch+Port+Attributes#Layer1andSwitchPortAttributes-SettingaPolicyforGlobalSystemMTU)

## ACLs

**NOTE:** Changing these settings will cause `switchd` to restart, which will stop network traffic

**NOTE:** Depending on atomic mode, updating ACLs may interrupt network traffic

* `cumulus_acl_non_atomic_update_mode`: Boolean - control non atomic update mode

Configure ACL rules with the `acl` hash in `config`. Each rule set is written to it's own file,
taking the key as the filename. The digits are important as they are used to control the order that
the rules are loaded. **00** and **99** are reserved by Cumulus.

Example:

```yaml
config:
  acl:
    10_some_rules:
      variables:
        - INGRESS = swp+
        - INPUT_PORT_CHAIN = INPUT,FORWARD
      iptables:
        - -A $INPUT_PORT_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
      ip6tables:
        - -A $INPUT_PORT_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
      ebtables:
        - -A INPUT -p IPv4 -j ACCEPT
    20_more_rules:
      ...
```

## DOS Protection

**NOTE:** Changing these settings will cause `switchd` to restart, which will stop network traffic.

Cumulus has hardware level DOS protection that is disabled by default. To enable, set `cumulus_dos_enable` to true.

* `cumulus_dos_enable`: Boolean - Set to true to enable DOS protection with the config values from
`defaults/main.yml`
* `cumulus_datapath_conf`: See `defaults/main.yml`, controls the various DOS options.
* `cumulus_datapath_conf_file`: Defaults to the location of the Broadcom config file.

For more information, See [Configuring Hardware-enabled DDOS Protection](https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/display/DOCS/Configuring+Hardware-enabled+DDOS+Protection) for more information.

## Breakout ports

**NOTE:** Changing these settings will cause `switchd` to restart, which will stop network traffic.

**NOTE:** Beware, removing port from `config.ports` will result in leaving the previous config behind.

100G switches allow you to breakout ports to 4x10G, 4x25G, etc with use of a breakout cable (or use
a different speed than 100G). For example, this will take `swp1` and make `swp1sN`, where N is 0 to
4 or 2, depending on which breakout type configured.

As of this writing, the options available to the Z9100 switch is:
* 4x10G
* 4x25G
* 2x50G
* 40G
* 50G
* 100G
* disabled

Example:

```yaml
config:
  ports:
    1: 4x10G
    2: 4x10G
```

## Administratively Down Interfaces

There may be a need to administratively shutdown interfaces.  This can be accomplished by using down key with a value of yes.

Example:

```yaml
config:
    interfaces:
        swp1:
            link:
                down: yes
```
